Neural Network from Scratch
This repository features a basic neural network built entirely from scratch using only NumPy. The neural network is designed to learn and predict a sine curve, making it a valuable educational resource for understanding fundamental concepts such as backpropagation.

Overview
The repository includes two implementations:

Case 1: One input corresponds to one output (e.g., y = sin(x)).
Case 2: Multiple inputs and one corresponding output.
For a more feature-rich implementation using popular deep learning libraries, refer to my other repository [link to your other repository].

Results
The results showcase training the neural network, assessing its performance on testing data, and visualizing predictions against target values and the original sine curve.

Performance Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) scores are computed to evaluate the neural network's performance on the testing set.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code. If you encounter any issues or have improvement suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy learning and coding!
